# Cognitive Anchoring of Color Cues on Online Review Ratings

This is the dataset collected for my poster at AMCIS 2017 ("Cognitive Anchoring of Color Cues on Online Review Ratings")[http://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2017/HumanCI/Presentations/2/].


The goal of the experiment is to test the effect of color cues on online review evaluations (the numeric part of the online review). To replicate this scenario in a lab experiment, I administered to the participants (college students) a fictional online review. Then I asked the participants to rate the experience according to: Cleanliness, Room, Overall, Sleep Quality, Service, Value. 

The interface for submitting the online review has four possible treatments:

1. *grey*: the selected score fills in grey when onclicked

2. *color*: the selected score fills with a color from red (score=1), to green (score=5) when oncliced

3. *green*: the selected score fills in grey when onclicked

4. *red*: the selected score fills in red when onclicked

To control for colorblindess we used a reduced version of the [Ishihara's Test](http://www.colour-blindness.com/colour-blindness-tests/ishihara-colour-test-plates/).
