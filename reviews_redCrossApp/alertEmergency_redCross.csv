maggoozer,4/20/15,Awareness,,I live in California and have elderly parents in Alabama.  This morning I received an alert to tornados in their area and could call them and make sure they were prepared.  In addition this app will give you shelter information and how to prepare for all kinds of disasters plus a way to reach out to loved ones to let them know you are safe and well if you are in a disaster.  Thank you Red Cross you Rock!!!,5
brANDonm00n,4/21/15,Interaction,,"More and More people don't watch regular TV to get Severe Weather Bulletins on Weather Stations, and more off tin than not you are away from a TV anyway for them to reach many folks in time. THIS APP IS BRILLIANT! Peace of mind when your away from home & loved ones and up-to-the-second alerts if weather emergency occur! It has a few bugs in this version but the notifications one of the most important and best uses of notifications yet! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!",4
Dynamododge,4/21/15,Performance,,Very well done. I recommend this app to anyone who needs weather warnings.,5
RvBill3,4/22/15,Fidelity,,"Great idea, but not ready yet. When you select a location to monitor, it lets you identify people who live there that you would like to notify in an emergency. Unfortunately, it automatically selects their work phone number and won't let you choose a different one. Also, no way to remove a person from a location--must delete the location and start over. This seems more like a beta version than one that is ready to distribute. When you are using an app to warn of danger, you need to know it is solid and ready to respond as needed. This one isn't ready.",2
Pontios20,4/22/15,Awareness,,The Notification system is awful. I end up getting the exact same notification every 10-15 minutes about the same warning. It gets pretty annoying. One notification of a severe thunderstorm warning is enough. The warnings aren't even updated with every notification. It's the exact same thing every time. Please fix this.,3
also191,4/22/15,Performance,,Great app,5
coalowl,4/23/15,Fidelity,,Needs a way to delete old alerts.,4
JCmobile,4/24/15,NA,,Great idea but it need lots of work.,1
arachne13,4/24/15,Fidelity,,The update erased all the information I'd entered. Not worth the trouble to add all the places and people again.,1
Are you f joking me,4/24/15,Fidelity,,This  app keeps displaying old alerts as new. Why is it that the developer feels the need to keep me informed about alerts months old?Please add a deletion link for old alerts or a setting to auto delete alerts after the fact.,1
CAS1951,4/24/15,Awareness,,"I truly like this app!  I can keep up to date in my own area, as well as track family out of my area!  I find comfort that I can get an alert from whatever location I enter and contact a loved one or friend of the possible threat.  Invaluable!",5
Vallentina777,4/25/15,Awareness,,Great app with so much information to prepare and monitor both yourself and your loved ones. Real time weather/disaster alerts. Love it.,5
Hgtyuij,4/27/15,,,As far as I can tell there is no app support.  All I want to know is is there a way to shut off old notifications? As soon as I set up it give me all the warnings that are old and expired and I seemingly can't get rid of them not even by swiping as some reviewer said!  What is the use of that?,2
Ems mom Lynn,4/27/15,NA,,Worth it.,5
Jbc in Nashville,4/30/15,NA,,Great App! Check it out!,5
Go Disney Fantasy,5/3/15,Interaction,,This is a great app I love how you get to pick the alerts,5
okiemusic,5/7/15,Fidelity,,"If you need an app that tells you about a tornado AFTER the tornado has passed, this is the app for you!! This app was consistently way behind all afternoon and evening. Thank goodness I have other, better apps, since I live in central Oklahoma.",1
HondoJ,5/8/15,Fidelity,,Notifications severe weather are either absent or way behind other weather apps. There is no way to delete old notifications some of which are now a month old or more.,2
Cfbtx2,5/10/15,Interaction,,Can't delete old alerts. No support. Visually too much clutter. Hard to navigate.,1
Teeebear,5/11/15,Fidelity,,"Great concept, but I just got a push notification about a tornado warning ""still in effect"", that was issued 23 hours ago. If you look at the list of alerts, it says it is over. The only thing I wanted out of the app was notifications of tornado warnings and watches, which I won't be able to rely on.",1
WmH2,5/11/15,Awareness,,"I was confused, because the alerts are coming in with today's date, but when you research it, you find out its 24 hours old. Not very helpful.",1
Former Alaskan,5/11/15,Fidelity,,Like the app but 30 hours later I am still getting tornado alerts from yesterday morning. Ready to delete due to false alarms.,2
Suzy_in_TX,5/11/15,Fidelity,,"I keep getting old alerts like they are new!!  Very frustrating to have gone through several days of flooding and tornadoes, think it's over, and then get an alert like it is going to start again!!  Please fix that issue!",2
Texas Red 8677,5/11/15,Fidelity,,In general a good app but lately I have been receiving alert notifications I have already read and that expired on the previous day. I get the old alert repeated not once but several times. I tried reinstalling the app but the glitch continues. It is really starting to annoy me.,4
Mlbogle,5/11/15,,,This App saved our lives last night!! We live in the country in Texas... No sirens... The local TV stations weren't even on!! At 2:45 am we headed for our safe area in the house!! My home security  system sounded the alarm 15 min later!! Love this app!! Thank you!!,5
trifonovg1,5/12/15,,,What good is an app that notifies you about an emergency HOURS after it's over. Useless. Deleted.,1
Ilistr8r,5/12/15,,,"Downloaded this app during a stormy night to stay on top of tornado warnings. It worked well for that purpose, now, two days later, and I still get warnings day and night for the same storm...I can't take it anymore, I have to delete..... Too bad.",2
Pikie Minnow,5/12/15,,,being woken in the middle of the night when receiving notifications 10 - 12 hours AFTER they have been issued and have long since expired. ???,2
mrXD888,5/15/15,,,So cool app!,5
TX07proud,5/16/15,,,"The app is a good idea however it gets frustrating when the notifications are repeatedly sent. Example: with severe weather this weekend, on Sunday I received notices again that expired on Sat night as well as ones that expired earlier in the day.",2
Iggyusa,5/18/15,,,"A great App, which works well on the iPhone, but seems to have some trouble on The Watch. Since it was featured in the Apple Watch App, this was a little surprising. On the Watch, the first time I used the Family Safe button to test it out, I got a list of people to check on and it worked perfectly. But after that, I could not check on anyone else, because each time I hit the Family Safe button, it went straight to the response from that first person and I could not check on anyone else. Not sure if this is a bug or if it's really supposed to work only from the phone.",3
MPJ1,5/20/15,,,"In the older RC emergency apps (hurricane, flood, wildfire, etc.), there were options to use several different modes of communication (Twitter, SMS, Email), and these seemed to have changed in this app (or it is not obvious). Also, if the user wants to MANUALLY enter their family lists, they are unable to. When the app first opens, if the user chooses not to allow access to contacts (like many of us would prefer not to), the ""add recipient"" button no longer works. So, you are stuck.Overall, I prefer this all-in-one app, but want the ""I'm safe"" functionality of the first waves of RC apps.",3
2 Bit Hacker,5/30/15,,,"I really want to like this app. I have family spread out all over the country and I'd like to know when there are emergencies in their areas, but the app keeps losing my locations lists.Also, when it is working, it'd be nice to be able to filter by alert severity, like severe weather warnings, but not watches.",2
Lidia213,6/6/15,,,"It's a great app, not just for the emergency notification, but also what to do during an a emergency.",5
Tdwolf,6/8/15,,,An absolute necessity for storms of all kinds,5
Babietaru,6/11/15,,,"I've had this app a few months and today I had to add my family/locations once again, making this the third time. I have 5 locations I monitor and it's annoying to keep adding them. It would be nice if it would quietly work and monitor in the background 24/7. When it works properly, it's a great app.",3
Miss Daisy aka Jan,6/12/15,,,Alerts every several minutes requesting more information. Too much info,1
vampireanarchy,6/15/15,,,Love the app but it's very buggy I have to go in to my location and keep resetting the notifications because the app keeps losing them just needs to be fixed  I am not getting notifications when I need them,5
TanyaNecole,6/21/15,,,"Love it. Great alternative to downloading all RC apps, and peace of mind comes with the ability to monitor friends/fan in other locations.",5
Green Mountain Jen,6/23/15,,,I love this app. It combines all the others into one user friendly version. Thumbs up!!,5
I tried to warn u,6/26/15,,,Great when it works but notifications aren't consistent. Sometimes you get them and sometimes you don't. I wouldn't rely on this app to keep me safe.,1
Bookaboo1977,6/28/15,,,The app used to work well. Then I stopped receiving notifications. Turns out it had forgotten my monitored locations and people. An app like this needs to be reliable; this one isn't.,1
sflomenb,7/1/15,,,Unable to use family safe on iOS 8.4.,1
DaiWil,7/6/15,,,This is no better than the previous tornado app by the Red Cross. They just don't seem to be able to get it right. I don't need warnings for storms many miles away and moving in the opposite direction. I thought it might be the fault of the National Weather Service. Not! The posted NWS warning posted by the app doesn't apply to my city.  A simple but accurate app would be much safer. People would likely pay attention and heed the warnings. My local TV station offers a free weather app that is accurate and reliable. I've also found some other great weather apps in the App Store. I knew this app was mistaken when not even one of the other apps sounded a warning.,1
whitmcghee,7/7/15,,,A flash flood warning was issued for my area last week. The Emergency app never notified me of a warning even though I confirmed that flash floods were turned on in settings. The Storm app notified me instantly.,3
Highlander Smurf,7/13/15,,,If you have more than one location you can't see the other alerts,1
HarleaMaria,8/3/15,,,"I been using this app for a while now and I never had a problem with it, it alerts me on time and very useful...worth the download",5
M2441,8/5/15,,,"The push alerts are very delayed, sometimes hours after the alert was issued",1
Emergency App User,8/12/15,,,"This app is concise yet thorough tool to make sure my friends and family are safe! It has an abundance of features to check weather conditions, prepare for emergencies and to stay sharp by taking quizzes - all the fantastic features of past Red Cross apps in one place!",5
1030 woo,8/12/15,,,The update works great!,5
Rocker827,8/13/15,,,Love the fact we can now delete alerts! An invaluable tool.,5
Fr. Time,8/14/15,,,Great app. Maybe asking for to much but what about family and friends on a DRO or just live in other countries.,4
HIMZ1976,8/14/15,,,Wonderful App for every type of Emergency Info,5
Daddy of GNAT,8/27/15,,,Twice now have updated my information only to find that it gets wiped out when doing an upgrade.  Also the create a plan is different from the other Red Cross apps and won't link them all together.  Also would be nice to be able to send plan to family members who could download info to their app.,3
Chief Wili,8/30/15,,,"I have had to enter my information 3 times and not only got kicked off, I'm made to start all over from the beginning. I really want this app to work. As an emergency professional that has gone through multiple events, I know the value of staying in touch.",1
kban495,9/12/15,,,How reliable can this app be at warning you if it continues to remove locations?,1
19392848,9/17/15,,,"I was really excited to use this app, but like others, my tracked locations have been ""lost"" twice since setting the app up originally about a month ago. It doesn't alert you, either, that your locations are lost, so you simply won't get alerts and won't know that you're not getting them.",2
rburguiere,10/10/15,,,Used this during the storms and flooding that hit and continues to hit the Carolina's.  The app team and the Red Cross were great in acknowledging a bug I encountered....and more importantly fixed it and followed up to notify me that they did so!!!,5
CERTmember,10/14/15,,,"This app is very handy and brilliantly designed. Everyone should have this on their phone in case of emergency, in addition to some of the other Red Cross apps.",5
Lightsoulsearcher,11/25/15,,,Three times it has wiped out all of my saved locations. I would really like it but it doesn't alert me when I have saved alerts and I am tired of inputting my locations.,2
SmugMugFan,12/11/15,,,"But I can't because it just lost all my saved places.  What good is an app like this if the places you monitor keep disappearing?But the first couple days I had it was great, I love the idea and being able to be aware of wildfires around my friends in California, tornadoes near my family in the Midwest and hurricanes near Florida. Please fix this soon and it will be back to 5 stars.",1
Oregonhelp,12/30/15,,,My data keeps disappearing! This would be so great if that didn't happen!,2
vel-cart,12/31/15,,,Living in an area with unpredictable weather. Love that I can keep tabs on other world wide locations with loved ones too!,5
Azhwybound,1/17/16,,,"I was woken up in Sarasota Florida to a loud siren on my phone with a warning about an approaching Tornado. Approximately 15 minutes later a tornado passed within a few miles of us. Shortly thereafter another alert sounded, and a second tornado passed through. Both tornados occurred between 3 & 4 a.m. Without this app we would have  likely slept through it, but we would have been fine. Unfortunately two people were killed just a few miles away and I can't help thinking that had they had a warning system like this they might have survived.",5
LTC Paul,1/28/16,,,"While reading a magazine from USAA insurance company, it recommended this app. The app asks for locations of ones you care about and provides teaching and quizzes with helpful emergency info presented in an interesting way.",5
sailingtwidget,2/13/16,,,"Looks like a great app. Unfortunately every time I update my phone (Part of Appleseed beta program) I have to completely rebuild my locations each time. With family all over the country and world, it makes for a long task.Once this is fixed (fed back to developers already) I would gladly put on my phone.",2
nadiaokc,2/23/16,,,App woke me up along with the furniture moving. Site/app really valuable. Highly recommend it.,5
Oreo kat,3/1/16,,,"It's very useful. I live in a place with strong winters, and thanks to this app I now know what to do during winter storms.",5
Jett Joxx,3/3/16,,,"This app has good review tests to help you plan ahead for emergencies.  Without burdening you with complicated steps to go through even someone such as a child (10 and older) can follow the easy-to-use step by step instructions.  I installed this app in all my families cell phones and Pads, even my 10 year old grandson.",5
The Real Mercutio,3/6/16,,,"This app is pretty useless because it employs thin, dim fonts that are too difficult for an elderly person like me to read quickly and easily.  This is a common mistake made by many app developers, who too often value form over function.  And the Red Cross finds this design approach acceptable for an app to be used in emergencies?  Ludicrous.",1
Maggie Pea,3/8/16,,,I love to be able to keep tabs on loved ones in an emergency but it took me about 6 X's to add a new location and ppl living there. Someone mentioned sometimes these ppl or locations just disappear after setting them up and it doesn't let you know this happened. Hope you can fix this bug.,5
Humpy special,3/12/16,,,"Woke up to a 4 am alert this Saturday to let me know here will be 8-18 inches of snow in the Seattle area. Followed by 1-2 feet more from noon on Sunday to noon on Monday.

What?It's raining and a little windy and all other weather apps say it will stay that way.",1
Longbackboy1,4/9/16,,,This is the best app ever! I love the weather anyway it fascinates me! Everyone should download this app because it is so accurate and so far no bugs! I downloaded this app two months ago! Had a couple of tornado warnings and my phone alerted me with a siren that would wake anyone! Love it!,5
Nancy5940,4/27/16,,,"This is a great app! With all the severe weather this spring, I wanted to be prepared wherever I'm at. This app does this for you.  The quizzes are quite informative!

RogusAngel,10/1/16,,,"I like this app, I can keep aware of situations for my family spread across the country. I would only change the ability to type in the alert distance. The slide kept changing after I lifted my finger.",5
Poppetwa,10/5/16,,,"I used to really like and appreciate the Emergency Apps from the Red Cross. Now since the iOS 10 update, they don't work. I'll get an alert, but can't open it for details. Just crashes.",1

BellaNise,10/7/16,,,"I'm in Hurricane Matthew's path. Relatives are evacuating. Yet this app stopped all alerts today, the most crucial day to prep! Instead the home page says, ""All is well"" with a sunny drawing. This is antithetical to the REAL weather that's occurring here! I'm in the mandatory curfew zone with a projected Cat 4 hurricane. Unbelievably POOR & useless in a real emergency!",1
Dechico2004,10/7/16,,,"This group took in 500 million dollars in charity relief for Haiti and then used it to buy 6 whole houses. That money helped 11 individuals.

Thin wal,10/9/16,,,I thought this app would give me up to date info as to where I can get supplies Right Now! We are on day 2 without power or water. The news radio said Red Cross is here giving out supplies but I didn't hear where. I thought this app would have that info!!,1

I am going to contact our IT department Monday and see where this leads. I have to see this through because people depend upon the Red Cross, I feel awful that you have confided in us and we have let you all down. I see all it has the ability to do, all that is great! I like the ability to set boundaries, notify family, alert you about your home address or your current location. When it's fixed I will try again. Please accept MY apology as a Red Cross Volunteer, I am sorry for everyone's trouble. Keep watch and give us another try when it's fixed!",1

JaneDoe789,12/28/16,,,"I like the idea of this app, but need improvement for the execution of it. For e.g., when using ""family safe,"" it just texts your family to see if they are safe or not; Doesn't provide the info on why I'm asking if they are safe or not (i.e. share details of emergency alert.) It's a problem because even if they are safe at the time, they could become in danger later if they aren't aware of what danger that might hit them.

Thank goodness I was getting Nixle alerts from the county sheriff. This app should be removed from all sites where it is available.",1
Random_65143,11/22/17,,,"If this Emergency Alert app is supposed to be all-purpose, the Wildfire functionality needs to be beefed up.  Unfortunately the Red Cross ""Wildfire"" app no longer works under the new IOS, and, this all-purpose Emergency app doesn't handle fires adequately.   Think about the Napa area fires this last October-what the functionality the app could have had that would have made things better for people who, it turned out, had little or no warning to evacuate from the fast-moving fires.",3
Sunthebun1,12/26/17,,,It' a good app but I would like to see windchill advisories and warnings.,3
Pitbull2000,1/11/18,,,Still a great app. However push notifications do not appear to be working on my iPhone X. I share the account with my mom but so don't think that would affect anything since push notifications appear to be working for my other apps. Needs looking into.,3
i8lutfisk,1/16/18,,,"Good for various alerts like fires, snow, rain, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc., but needs work.It prompts you for people you care about in a particular town that you specify. But if you exit the app then those contacts are lost. Same with the ""I'm safe"" feature - great idea but in an emergency I want the contacts loaded and ready so I can just send loved ones the message that I'm alright. Those contacts aren't saved either. Otherwise good app.",3

sleepnclass,1/23/18,,,Constantly crashes on iPhone X on latest firmware.,1
Lady.CF,1/24/18,,,"I live in Southern California and with the potential for earthquakes, wildfires, and strong winds, I downloaded this app immediately after finding out about it in late November 2017.In the two months I've used it, I've found it is not reliable and not consistent, with some alerts being false information altogether. Specifically, during the first three weeks of December 2017, wildfires due to heavy winds were popping up every day all over SoCal. I had settings to alert me of all fire activity within 50 miles of my location. Frustratingly, I never received alerts for the wildfires that were within 50 miles of my home. Instead, I was receiving alerts for wildfires in Central and Northern California. Of course, I was attentive to local and regional news to be aware of any sudden evacuation orders. Still, it is a scary thought to think that this app is not providing the life saving alerts that it claims to do.In addition to the wildfires and others, I also set an alert for earthquakes with a 3.0 magnitude or higher. There was an earthquake in my region after Christmas that registered as a 3.5 and nope, no alert received. Not even a delayed alert.The only alerts that seem to be reliable and are correct are those for strong winds, winter windchill, and tsunami warning. I'll keep the app because it is better than nothing but I do really hope that it is fine tuned to provide correct and reliable data consistently. It could save lives.",2
RsTile,2/11/18,,,"This is a great app. It keeps me informed abt oncoming and current severe weather situations, and allows me to keep in touch with my family and friends. I love that it shows a weather radar and also if needed lists shelters I can go to in an emergency.",5

Jesus is my Savior!!!,3/27/17,,,"I love this app, and it's always been very functional! This a must-have and highly needed warning tool (tornadoes are all too common around my area). I definitely recommend this app! Plus, it alerts me when there are serious weather issues in the various places that my family and friends live. While I cannot speak for the others having issues with this app, I definitely sympathize with each of them! Living in a rural area, known for tornadic activity, I completely understand the importance of needing to know have accurate, timely reports regarding 'your weather activity' or that of your family or friends...ASAP! However, I haven't had any problems, and this app works perfectly for me! I have alerts set up to cover several locations, other than my own, with some that are 12-14 hours away, and so far, I've never had a single issue. I'm praying it stays this way too ðð»!",5

I had to delete all of my children and start over in order to add another location!  Not cool considering this is in the middle of emergency evacuation preparation. That's ridiculous.

jamiller6620,3/1/17,,,"Downloaded app because I moved to a new area of the country and there are tornado warnings and watches in effect. The app does issue alerts to my iPhone, but I have found three points of frustration: (1) the app automatically uses my current location. I set up my city as a location for when I travel away from my family but I receive double alerts for my city even after turning off and deleting the current location from my alerts. (2) When trying to view alerts, they do often do not load and I receive an error message. (3) I live in a city with Burroughs.

Trizz de boss,3/21/17,,,"If there were more features I probably would have given this a higher Rating. One such feature would probably be the radar/map for weather. seeing what kind of weather we might get can be helpful. Also when I first got it I was looking for something specifically, if a nuke was launched, would it let me know? I don't think so. due to the progress of NK missile testing g I feel as if that's one thing I should be prepared for, and I also think that is something they should add.I do like how they can add other people  and the weather alerts, although I have not gotten one, because I literally just got it.",3

What the heck?!! This app is pointless.
